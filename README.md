Diagram Application
===================

Create various types of diagrams using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

This is a simple application created using [AppWithinMinutes](http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/App+Within+Minutes+Application) and integrating [jgraph/draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/). It supports both editing and viewing diagrams. Each diagram is stored in a wiki page. It doesn't require any external services in order to work properly.

## Building

Run the following command from the project root to generate the `.xar` package:

```bash
mvn package
```

The resulting file will be located under `target/` as `application-diagram-<version>.xar`.
You can also trigger the `Package XAR` GitHub workflow to build and archive this file automatically.
